> Why not track everything about myself? 

Instead of writing a manual journal each evening, why not pull various info from API's of the apps that I am using daily? I am big on tracking things, storing things, reflecting on things.. this app will be perfect for that. I can see myself using it for years to come.. :)\

## Inspiration for this app

* Big big inspiration - using SQL as a life database [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/rru1re/using_sql_as_a_life_database/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
* Telegram bot example - [howisfelix.today site](https://howisfelix.today). His site on [github](https://github.com/KrauseFx/FxLifeSheet).
* Tracking in excel also looks fine [excample 1](https://dailyvis.com/posts/quantified-self-why-i-track-my-life-in-data/), [example 2](https://dailyvis.com/posts/self-analysis-with-my-quantified-self-data/), [example 3](https://dailyvis.com/vis/compare/demo/).
