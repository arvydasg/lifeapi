# Lifeapi

Why not track everything about myself. Instead of writing a manual
journal each evening, why not pull various info from API's of the apps
that I am using daily?

Big big inspiration - using SQL as a life database

Tracking with excel, looks fine:

Some of the things will get fetched from an api, okay.

But what about the manual entries? Like mood/gym/cold shower and
similar? Should I create a telegram bot? Could, but I am not sure how
telegram ecosystem will change in the future and I don't really want
to be depended on that.. better - I will create a django app with user
login and so on and then be able to answer questions there. Perhaps in
the future give my family or friends to use this app to track their
manual (or maybe even api) stuffs about their life.
